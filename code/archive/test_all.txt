The saying "it ain't over till the fat lady sings" is believed to have originated from the imagery of Richard Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen, specifically the last part called G√∂tterd√§mmerung.

Therefore, the saying implies that it is truly over when Br√ºnnhilde sings, as G√∂tterd√§mmerung represents the end of the world or the world of the Norse gods.
