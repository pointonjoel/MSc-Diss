The water is carried by the transpiration stream through a process called osmosis. Water enters the root hairs from the soil due to a higher water potential in the soil compared to the cytoplasm of the root hair cells. This occurs because the cell's surface membrane is semi-permeable, allowing osmosis to take place. The water then moves into the xylem vessels either by passing through the cortex cells or bypassing them through their cell walls. From there, the water moves up the xylem vessels to the leaves through diffusion, which is facilitated by a pressure change between the top and bottom of the vessel. Finally, the water moves into the mesophyll cells in the leaves and evaporates out of the cells into the spaces between the cells. It then leaves the leaf and the plant through diffusion via stomata.
