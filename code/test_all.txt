Many place names in Chinese history have multiple spellings because of the adoption of different romanization systems over time. The pinyin romanization system, which is derived from Mandarin, was officially adopted in China in 1958 and later by the International Organization for Standardization in 1982. However, it is not universally applied in all regions of China or in the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. Additionally, the previous romanization systems, such as the postal romanization and Wade-Giles, were based on Cantonese, which was the common language in British-held Hong Kong. Therefore, the changes in spelling can appear drastic due to the shift in romanization systems.

The process of frost wedging contributes to the weathering of rock by exerting pressure on the rock through the expansion of freezing water.

This process is particularly important within a few centimeters of a rock's surface and on larger existing water-filled joints, known as ice wedging.

The republican and Whig ideas affected American colonists by influencing their perception of politics and their desire for liberty. The colonists were convinced by the writings of the radical Whigs, which emphasized the importance of vigilance in protecting their liberties. These ideas played a significant role in the American Revolution, as the colonists felt indignant about their lack of representation and various taxes imposed by the Kingdom of Great Britain. As a result, they broke away from Britain and formed the United States of America. The ideas of the Whigs resonated with the colonists because they aligned with their traditional concerns rooted in a Protestant culture that valued virtue, frugality, industry, and a limited executive power. The colonists sought to establish a political system that incorporated these ideas, which were influenced by the eighteenth-century commonwealthmen.

Swap long and swap short in forex refer to the positions held by traders after a foreign exchange transaction settles. When a transaction settles, the trader is left with a positive or "long" position in one currency and a negative or "short" position in another currency. These positions are then used to collect or pay overnight interest on foreign balances. To manage these positions, institutions often use "tom-next" swaps, where they buy or sell a foreign amount settling tomorrow and then reverse the transaction by selling or buying it back settling the day after.
