A: Image segmentation is used to extract specific objects or regions from an image.

Q: What is the frequency domain method in image processing?
A: Frequency domain methods involve computing and modifying the power spectrum of an image.

A: Geometric operations allow for changes in the image's array structure, and include the manipulation of the orientation, rotation, and scaling.

Q: What is content-based image retrieval?
A: Content-based image retrieval is a technique for searching large image databases based on their visual content.

Q: What is painterly rendering in image processing?
A: Painterly rendering involves processing an image to give it the appearance of a painting, based on the work of a particular artist or movement (e.g. impressionism).

Q: What are interactive tools and compositing in image processing?
A: Interactive tools and compositing involve overlaying and combining multiple images into a single output image.

Q: What are some programming languages commonly used for image processing?
A: Commonly used languages include MATLAB, Python (with libraries like PIL and OpenCV), and Java.

Q: What are the two important processes in digital image formation?
A: Sampling and quantization.

Q: What is sampling in digital image formation?
A: Sampling is the process of digitizing the spatial coordinates of an image.

Q: What is quantization in digital image formation?
A: Quantization is the process of digitizing the light intensity function of an image.

Q: What is aliasing and what causes it?
A: Aliasing is an artifact that occurs when the sampling rate is insufficient, causing the image to become unrecognizable. It is caused by undersampling or sampling at a rate below the Nyquist rate.

Q: How many pixels are in an image?
A: The number of pixels in an image depends on its resolution and size. It can vary from image to image.

Q: How many samples should you take from an image?
A: Samples must be taken at a rate that is twice the frequency of the highest frequency component to be reconstructed

Q: What is the Nyquist Rate?
A: The minimum sampling rate required to accurately reconstruct an image from its sampled version

Q: What is under-sampling?
A: Sampling at a rate which is too course, i.e. below the Nyquist Rate.

Q: What causes Aliasing?
A: Aliasing is called by under-sampling.

Q: What is unsampling
A: The process of reconstructing an image by interpolating pixel values from the sample values

Q: What is super resolution?
A: Super resolution methods involve combining multiple exposures of the same scene to enhance the resolution and quality of an image.

Q: What is a Bayer pattern?
A: An array of red, green, and blue color filters arranged in a specific repeating pattern.

Q: Out of red, green and blue, which colour are our eyes drawn to most?
A: Human eyes are most drawn to the colour green.

Q: What is color intensity in an image?
A: Color intensity refers to the level of intensity or brightness of a color in an image. It determines the perceived lightness or darkness of a color.

Q: How can aliasing be avoided in image sampling?
A: Aliasing can be avoided in image sampling by ensuring that the sampling rate is at least twice the frequency of the highest frequency component to be reconstructed.

Q: How does interpolation help in image sampling?
A: Interpolation helps in image sampling by estimating unknown pixel values based on known neighboring pixel values, filling in the gaps and producing a smoother representation of the image.

Q: Can grey level resolution be increased in a single image?
A: No, grey level resolution cannot be increased in a single image

Q: Why is greyscale used in image processing
A: It makes processing easier, reduces the amount of information in the image, and makes some of the theory simpler.

Q: How can you convert between colour and greyscale images?
A: By using a weighted average of the red, green, and blue components, with a higher weighting on green (30% red, 59% green, and 11% blue).

Q: What is HSV color space?
A: HSV color space stands for hue, saturation, and value. It is a color model that represents colors based on their hue (the dominant wavelength), saturation (purity of color), and value (brightness). It is based on colour rather than light.

Q: Is HSV more or less sensitive to illumination changes relative to RGB?
A: Less sensitive

Q: What two components of HSV is human skin most captured by, out of hue, saturation, and value?
A: Human skin is most captured by the hue and saturation components of HSV.

Q: What is an intensity transform?
A: An intensity transform alters the intensity values of pixels in an image, mapping the original pixel intensities to new intensity values. It is used to manipulate the brightness, contrast, or overall distribution of intensity levels in an image. These transformations can be linear or nonlinear, and they are applied to individual pixels or groups of pixels in the image.

Q: In an linear intensity transform, what is the interpretation of the a and b parameters?
A: A refers to the gain, and b refers to the bias.

Q: What does the gain in a linear intensity affect?
A: The gain affects the contrast

Q: What does the bias in a linear intensity affect?
A: The gain affects the brightness

Q: What is negation?
A: Negation refers to the operation of inverting or reversing the pixel intensities of an image. It is also known as image inversion.

Q: What is the main benefit of negation?
A: The main benefit of negation is that it makes fine details more visible (e.g. digital mammograms).

Q: What is contrast stretching?
A: It is a transformation used to convert pixel intensities from one range to another range.

Q: What type of transformation is Thresholding?
A: Thresholding is a form of non-linear transformation.

Q: What is thresholding?
A: A threshold level where any value above it is accepted, and any value below it is rejected. The division of acceptance and rejection is used to either preserve intensities or remove intensities to black.

Q: What is a gamma correction used for?
A: It is used to display an image using a voltage which displays a true representation of the image.

Q: Do point processes affect an image as a whole, or each pixel independently?
A: Point processes operate on each picel independently

Q: Do linear processes affect an image as a whole, or each pixel independently?
A: Linear processes change the appearance of the whole image

Q: What are non-linear processes used for?
A: Non-linear transformations are used to differentiate between different object/image regions.
