The digestion and absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine occur through the action of enzymes such as salivary alpha-amylase, pancreatic amylase, gluco-amylase, maltase, isomaltase, sucrase, and lactase. The process begins with the hydrolysis of starch by amylase, resulting in the formation of alpha-dextrin. Gluco-amylase further breaks down alpha-dextrin into maltose and maltotriose. These products, along with dietary disaccharides, are then hydrolyzed into monosaccharides by enzymes present in the brush border of the small intestine. In a typical Western diet, carbohydrate digestion and absorption primarily occur in the upper small intestine, but when the diet includes carbohydrates that are not easily digestible, the process mainly takes place in the ileal portion of the intestine.

The phrase "when the fat lady sings" comes from the imagery of Richard Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen and its last part, Götterdämmerung.

Her farewell scene in Götterdämmerung lasts almost twenty minutes and leads directly to the finale of the entire Ring Cycle. In a significant way, "it is (all) over when the fat lady sings" as Götterdämmerung represents the end of the world or the world of the Norse gods.

Advantages of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) over other types of fuel cells include lower operating temperature, lighter and more compact design, making them suitable for applications like cars. Disadvantages include the low operating temperature, which limits cogeneration, and the requirement for the electrolyte to be water-saturated. High-temperature PEMFCs operating between 100 °C and 200 °C offer potential benefits in terms of electrode kinetics, heat management, and tolerance to fuel impurities. However, the current gold-standard membranes lose function rapidly at temperatures above 100 °C if hydration drops below a certain level, leading to lower system lifetimes. New anhydrous proton conductors are being actively studied for the development of suitable PEMs.

Short tandem repeat DNA is useful for DNA fingerprinting because it contains highly polymorphic regions with short repeated sequences of DNA. These repeated sequences, which can vary in length, are unique to individuals and can be used to distinguish between unrelated individuals. By targeting these STR loci and amplifying them using PCR, scientists can generate DNA fragments that can be separated and detected using electrophoresis. This allows for the discrimination and identification of different DNA profiles, making STR analysis a valuable tool in forensic analysis.

The correspondence principle operates within school by relating the social relations and structure of the school to those in the work-place. It suggests that educational institutions prepare students for their future work roles. Additionally, the personal experience given to each student, known as the hidden curriculum, is considered important for their future socialization. The advocates of the correspondence principle also highlight the strong relationship between a child's education and their interaction with their parents at home. There is an intergenerational replication of consciousness and socialized inequality through the linkages among authority relations experienced by fathers at work, transferred to childrearing styles, and replicated in school interaction with teachers.

To play the game truth or dare, Player 1 starts by asking another player to choose "truth or dare". If the player chooses "truth", Player 1 asks an embarrassing question that the player must answer truthfully. If the player chooses "dare", Player 1 dares them to do something embarrassing or dangerous, which they must do. The player cannot choose "truth" for the whole time. If the player does not like the dare, they can request a new one, but a dare cannot undo a previous dare. After answering the question or performing the dare, the player asks "truth or dare?" to another player, and the game continues. Sometimes, someone might choose "double dare", which allows both the person who dares and the person being dared to have an action suggested for them to perform. A player cannot dare another player to choose "truth". Sometimes, a bottle is used to spin within the circle of players to select the next player to be questioned, indicated by the cap or cork of the bottle.
