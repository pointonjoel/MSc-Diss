However, an earlier use of the term is found in Ralph Roister Doister, which is believed to have been written in 1553 and published in 1567. In nineteenth-century American culture, "tomboy" referred to a specific code of conduct that allowed young girls to engage in physical activities, wear practical clothing, and maintain a healthy diet. This concept gained popularity as an alternative to the traditional feminine code of conduct that restricted women's physical movement. The idea of being a tomboy was praised for its health benefits and the freedom it provided for gender exploration. The phase of being a tomboy was considered important for physical development between the ages of eight and thirteen, according to playground advocate Joseph Lee in 1915. Tomboyism continued to be popular in society, literature, and film during World War I and World War II.

If the player chooses "truth", Player 1 asks an embarrassing question that the player must answer truthfully. If the player chooses "dare", Player 1 dares them to do something embarrassing or dangerous, which they must do. The player cannot choose "truth" for the whole time. If the player does not like the dare, they can request a new one, but a dare cannot undo a previous dare. After completing the truth or dare, the player then asks "truth or dare?" to another player, and the game continues.

A player cannot dare another player to choose "truth".

The origin of the last name Bell can be traced back to Middle English, where it likely originated as an occupational name for a bell ringer or bell maker. It could also be derived from a topographic name for someone who lived near a bell or by a house or inn sign. Additionally, the surname Bell can be derived from the medieval personal name Bel, which has masculine and feminine forms. In some cases, it may originate from a nickname meaning "beautiful" or "fair" in Old French. There are also instances where the surname Bell represents an English form of the Gaelic surname Mac Giolla Mhaoil, meaning "son of the servant of the devotee." It is worth noting that the surname Bell can also have origins in placenames in Norway and Germany. In Germany, it could be associated with the surnames Böhl or Böll.

To put a car on two wheels, one technique is to drive one pair of wheels up on a ramp to lift one side of the car. Another technique is to turn sharply or at speed in a vehicle with a high center of gravity, such as a 4x4 or SUV. Letting some air out of the tires that will be on the ground can also help the car tip more easily and maintain balance. Once on two wheels, the car must be balanced by steering, similar to riding a bicycle, and driven in a straight line. The vehicle used should have a lockable differential. The stunt was first performed by Tonny Peterson of Copenhagen, Denmark at the 1964 World Fair.

The republican and Whig ideas affected American colonists by influencing their perception of politics and their desire for liberty. The colonists were convinced by the writings of the radical Whigs, which emphasized the importance of vigilance in protecting their liberties. These ideas played a significant role in the development of the American Revolution, as the colonists felt indignant about their perceived lack of representation and taxes imposed by the Kingdom of Great Britain. As a result, they broke away from Britain and formed the United States of America. The ideas of the Whigs resonated with the colonists because they revived traditional concerns of a Protestant culture that valued virtue, frugality, industry, and a limited executive power. The colonists' political system was influenced by the ideas of the Whigs and the broader tradition of eighteenth-century commonwealthmen.

The saying "when the fat lady sings" comes from the imagery of Richard Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen and its last part, Götterdämmerung. The "fat lady" refers to the valkyrie Brünnhilde, who is traditionally depicted as a buxom lady with a horned helmet, spear, and round shield. Her farewell scene in Götterdämmerung lasts almost twenty minutes and leads directly to the finale of the entire Ring Cycle. In a significant way, the saying implies that "it is (all) over when the fat lady sings" as Götterdämmerung is about the end of the world or the world of the Norse gods.

The term "mom and dad" is thought to have originated from the nature of language acquisition. Babies often babble and produce sounds similar to "ma" and "pa" as their first word-like sounds. Parents then associate these sounds with themselves and use them as part of their baby-talk lexicon. Therefore, the similarities in terms like "mama" and "papa" across different languages are not necessarily due to common ancestry. Some scientists believe that "ma" and "pa" were among the first words spoken by humans.

The degree sequence problem can determine if a given sequence of positive integers can be the degree sequence of a graph. If the sum of the sequence is odd, such as (3, 3, 1), it cannot be realized as the degree sequence of a graph. However, if the sum of the sequence is even, it can be the degree sequence of a multigraph. The construction of such a graph involves connecting vertices with odd degrees in pairs and filling out the remaining even degree counts with self-loops. The question of whether a given degree sequence can be realized by a simple graph is more challenging and can be solved using the Erdős--Gallai theorem or the Havel--Hakimi algorithm.

The chalk headland that Old Harry Rocks is a part of used to be a longer stretch of chalk between Purbeck and the Isle of Wight.

Eventually, the tops of these arches collapsed due to weakening from rainfall and wind, leaving disconnected stacks. One of these stacks is known as Old Harry. Old Harry's Wife, another stack, was eroded through corrosion and abrasion until the bottom became weak and the top fell away, leaving a stump.

Many place names in Chinese history have multiple spellings because of the adoption of different romanization systems over time.

The blue lake in Mt Gambier is blue during the summer months because of the warming of the surface layers of the lake, causing calcium carbonate to precipitate out of the solution and form micro-crystallites.
