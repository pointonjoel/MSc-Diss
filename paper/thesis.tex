% The maximum length of a dissertation is 20,000 words. Marks may be deducted where a dissertation is unnecessarily long, and that markers will be instructed to stop reading dissertations after the maximum limit. Many high-quality dissertations are in the range 10,000-20,000 words. The word count will include everything in the body of the text, such as quotations, citations, footnotes and headings. It does not include title pages, contents lists, acknowledgements, bibliography, references, appendices or other supplementary material.

% Note: Your dissertation should not exceed the word and page limits. You do not have to use up your word limit to get a good grade; never `pad out' your dissertation, this will only annoy the markers.
