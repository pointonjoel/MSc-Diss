To my beautiful fianc√©e - the very soon-to-be Lily Pointon. You have been my biggest fan and supported me this summer as we prepare for our adventure together! Thanks for listening to me, letting me complain about why things aren't working, and learning enough to write your own dissertation on this... I can't wait for the next stage of life together! 

My unreserved gratitude and thanks go to the spirited and supportive Tissa Chandesa. Your supervision sessions and guidance on how to proceed following (many) obstacles has been very much appreciated.

I also owe Irfan Yaqub my thanks for his expertise and availability to help with debugging. Your assistance has been gratefully received and I wish you all the best with your PhD.

A huge thanks to my future in-laws, Richard and Julianne, for graciously allowing me to check the training progress of my models during mealtimes, and enabling me to work as much as possible during the time I spent in Canterbury.

My final thanks go to my wonderful parents, Mum and Dad - your constant support, encouragement and love have helped me get to not only get onto this Master's course, but to thrive on it. Thanks for all your help with planning the wedding and finding a flat, I can't wait to celebrate with you - I love you both!
